There's also a hybryid approach.

You can declare a spring data repository (extending `CrudRepository`) and further extend
it with your custom interface (`TaskRepositoryCustom`). Then you provide an implementation for your custom interface
( `TaskRepositoryCustomImpl` ). The custom repo implementation has to be the name of the interface
plus the `Impl` suffix for this to work.

This way you let spring provide the implementation for the basic methods, and still use
the more powerful `MongoOperations` to do your specific queries.

This way you get partial transaction support - the `MongoOperations` part will be fine,
but the autogenerated part won't participate in transactions still.
