There's also a more low-level approach for defining your persistence. Spring comes with
a `MongoOperations` interface, implemented by `MongoTemplate`.

It gives you better control over your persistence logic, also makes up for the stuff unsupported
by autogenerated repositories:

- transactions
- findAndModify operation

`MongoOperations` comes with a DSL for defining your queries and updates, which makes it easy to use,
though still it has to be written by hand.
